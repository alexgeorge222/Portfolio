		<sDescription>Iconic palace on the River Thames</sDescription>
		<lDescription>Housing both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the palace has been the home of petty
		squabbling and useless bickering for almost 200 years.  This of course after the old palace burned down as a result
		of a chimney fire.  The complex is also home to the famous clocktower commonly known as Big Ben, although
		it is well known that this tower is actually known as the Elizabeth Tower, and Big Ben is just the largest bell in the tower
		Now you can accuse your friends of being idiot tourist for not knowing this. </lDescription>
