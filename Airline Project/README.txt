Airline Routes:

This program uses a weighted graph to availiable routes from an airline (provided by a file)
The program begins by asking a user for a text file (several exapmles are provided). The user then has several options
	1.Show the entire list of direct routes, distances and prices
	2.Display a minumum spanning tree based on distances
	3.Allow for shortest path searches based on the following criteria
		a.Shortest path based on total miles
		b.Shortest path based on prices
		c.Shortest path based on number of hops from sourse to destination
	4.Give all trips that are less than a certain dollar amount for a user
	5.Add a new route to the schedule
	6.Remove a route from the schedule
	7.Quit the program

This program implements the following code:
